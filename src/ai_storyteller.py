AI Storyteller Interface - FOR FUTURE SESSIONS (Days 4-5)

INSTRUCTOR NOTES:
This file is a simple stub for Day 1. It provides basic functionality
so the game doesn't crash, but the real AI features will be implemented
in later sessions when students are ready.

Key concepts for later sessions:
1. API communication with Ollama
2. Prompt engineering for kid-friendly content
3. Error handling for network issues
4. Fallback behavior when AI isn't available

For Day 1: Students should know this exists but not worry about it.

INSTRUCTOR NOTES FOR FUTURE SESSIONS:

DAY 4-5 IMPLEMENTATION GOALS:
When students are ready for AI features, this file will be expanded with:

1. REAL CONNECTION TESTING:
   def test_connection(self) -> bool:
       try:
           response = requests.get(f"{self.url}/api/tags", timeout=2)
           return response.status_code == 200
       except:
           return False

2. AI ENHANCEMENT:
   def enhance_description(self, base_text: str, history: list) -> str:
       if not self.available:
           return base_text
       
       prompt = f'''You are a friendly storyteller for kids aged 8-11.
       Enhance this story segment, keeping it short (2-3 sentences), 
       age-appropriate, and exciting.
       
       Story so far: {' '.join(history[-3:])}
       Current scene: {base_text}
       
       Enhanced description:'''
       
       # Make API call to Ollama here
       # Return enhanced text or fallback to original

3. CONTENT FILTERING:
   def filter_content(self, text: str) -> str:
       # Check for inappropriate content
       # Return filtered/safe version

4. PROMPT CUSTOMIZATION:
   Students can modify prompts to change the AI's personality:
   - Funny storyteller
   - Mysterious narrator  
   - Educational guide
   - Different story themes

TEACHING PROGRESSION:
- Day 4: Explain APIs, show simple connection testing
- Day 5: Implement prompt engineering, content filtering
- Advanced: Custom personalities, multiple AI models

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Always run locally or on instructor's machine
- Content filtering for age-appropriate responses  
- Fallback to original text if AI fails
- No external API calls or data collection
