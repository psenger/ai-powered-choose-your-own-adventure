AI-Powered Choose Your Own Adventure Game
Entry Point - DO NOT MODIFY

INSTRUCTOR NOTES:
This is the starting point of our adventure game. When students run this file,
it starts the console-based adventure game.

Key concepts to explain:
1. Importing modules (bringing in code from other files)
2. The main() function as an entry point
3. How Python programs start execution
4. Simple console input/output

Students should understand this file but NOT modify it.
The focus should be on other files where they'll make changes.

    INSTRUCTOR EXPLANATION:
    - Creates a console interface object
    - Starts the game loop which handles all user interaction
    - Much simpler than GUI - just input() and print()!
