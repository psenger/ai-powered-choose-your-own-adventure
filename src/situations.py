"""
Story Database - STUDENTS EXTEND THIS

INSTRUCTOR NOTES:
This file contains the heart of our adventure game - all the story situations!
This is where students will spend most of their creative time.

Key concepts to explain:
1. Dictionaries - like a real dictionary, each situation has a "key" and information
2. Nested data structures - dictionaries inside dictionaries
3. Lists of dictionaries - multiple choices in each situation
4. How the game flows from one situation to another

STUDENT ACTIVITIES:
- Read and understand the example situations
- Modify descriptions to make them more exciting
- Add new situations by copying the pattern
- Create branching storylines

INSTRUCTOR TEACHING POINTS:

1. DICTIONARY STRUCTURE:
   - Show how each situation is like a filing cabinet
   - The key (like "start") is the label on the drawer
   - The value (the dictionary) is everything inside the drawer
   - Demonstrate: SITUATIONS["start"] gets the start situation

2. NESTED DICTIONARIES:
   - Point out how choices are dictionaries inside the main dictionary
   - Show the pattern: text, next, requires
   - Explain how "next" connects situations together

3. LISTS AND DICTIONARIES TOGETHER:
   - The "choices" key contains a LIST of dictionaries
   - Each choice is its own dictionary with the same structure
   - Show how to access: SITUATIONS["start"]["choices"][0]["text"]

4. STUDENT ACTIVITIES:
   - Have students modify descriptions to be more exciting
   - Show them how to add a new situation by copying the pattern
   - Demonstrate how "next" values must match situation keys
   - Practice adding choices that connect to existing situations

5. CREATIVE WRITING CONNECTION:
   - Connect this to English class - story structure, plot development
   - Encourage creative descriptions with sensory details
   - Show how choices create branching narratives

COMMON MISTAKES TO WATCH FOR:
- Missing commas between dictionary items
- Typos in "next" values that don't match situation keys  
- Forgetting quotes around strings
- Missing square brackets around choice lists
- Incorrect indentation (Python is picky about this!)

DEBUGGING TIPS FOR STUDENTS:
- If you get an error, check for missing commas
- Make sure "next" situation names exist in SITUATIONS
- Count your opening and closing brackets/braces
- Ask a friend to proofread your punctuation
