# Module 1 - Programming Primitives and Fundamentals

## Learning Objective

In this module, students will learn the **fundamental building blocks of programming** - the basic data types, input/output operations, decision-making, and repetition that form the foundation of all computer programs. These are the "LEGO blocks" that all programming is built from.

## What You'll Learn

### ðŸ§± Programming Primitives - The Basic Building Blocks
- **Strings**: Working with text and words in Python
- **Numbers**: Using integers and floating-point numbers for calculations
- **Booleans**: Understanding True/False values and logic
- **Variables**: Storing and using information in your programs

### ðŸ’¬ Input and Output Operations
- **Output**: Displaying information to users with `print()`
- **Input**: Getting information from users with `input()`
- **Interactive Programming**: Creating programs that respond to user input
- **Data Conversion**: Converting between text and numbers

### ðŸ¤” Decision Making with If-Then-Else
- **Simple If Statements**: Making basic decisions in code
- **If-Else Statements**: Choosing between two options
- **If-Elif-Else Chains**: Handling multiple different conditions
- **Boolean Logic**: Using AND, OR, and NOT to make complex decisions
- **Comparison Operators**: Greater than, less than, equal to

### ðŸ”„ Repetition with Loops
- **For Loops**: Repeating actions a specific number of times
- **While Loops**: Repeating actions until a condition is met
- **Loop Control**: Using break and continue statements
- **Nested Loops**: Loops inside other loops for complex patterns
