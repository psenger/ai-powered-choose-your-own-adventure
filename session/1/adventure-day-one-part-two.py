    This function shows all the choices to the player
    It's like a menu at Maccas - here are your options!

    This function gets the player's choice and gives it back
    It's like asking "What flavour ice cream do you want?" and waiting for an answer

    PROGRAMMING GAP ALERT! üö®
    This function doesn't check if the player types something silly like "banana" or "42"
    What happens if someone types "pizza"? The program might get as confused as a kangaroo in a shopping centre!

    This function handles when someone types something unexpected

    This game only lets you make ONE choice and then it ends!
    Real adventures have lots of choices - like choosing between
    Tim Tams or Anzac biscuits (why not both?!)
