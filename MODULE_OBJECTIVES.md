## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### **For Instructors**:

1. **Pre-prepared Code**: Have working versions of all complex files ready
2. **Simplified Versions**: Create "training wheels" versions of advanced concepts
3. **Backup Plans**: USB drives with all files in case of technical issues
4. **Helper Strategy**: Pair stronger students with those who need help

### **Time Management**:
- **Buffer Time**: Each session has 5-10 min buffer for technical issues
- **Flexible Breaks**: Can extend breaks if students need more setup time
- **Rush Strategy**: If behind, focus on making things work rather than understanding every detail

### **Learning Approach**:
- **Show First**: Demonstrate working code before explaining how it works
- **Modify Second**: Let students change working code to see effects
- **Create Third**: Only if time allows, have them write from scratch

### **Assessment Strategy**:
- **Success Metric**: Can they run and modify the final game?
- **Understanding Check**: Can they explain what happens when they change data.ini?
- **Creativity Bonus**: Did they personalize their game with unique content?

This schedule prioritizes **hands-on success** over **theoretical completeness**, ensuring every child leaves with a working game they created and modified themselves! üéÆ‚ú®
